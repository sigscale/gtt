# Global Title Translation (GTT)

The 'gtt` application implements an SCCP stack as an M3UA-User,  
performing SCCP Management procedures and transfer of SCCP PDUs.

Application Server (AS) state handling is provided with endpoints
both local and distributed. PDUs may be transfered to SCCP-User
processes (e,g, TCAP) or other M3UA endpoints.
